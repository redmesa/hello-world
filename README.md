My name is Matthew Mitchell. I am currently working at Navajo Tribal Utility Authority as an Enterprise Solutions Architect. I'm in the GIS master program to learn more about GIS and how to incorporate it into our NTUA workflows. I got an undergrad from the University of Minnesotaâ€”Morris in Computer Science, and before that, I was an Infantryman in the US Army.
